#//////////Create an if statement that uses elsif and else with valid syntax from memory//////////

# 1. Use a variable to store a number, then write a condition that prints 0 if the number is equal to 10, and prints -1 otherwise.
# x = 25
# if x == 10
#   p 0
# else
#   p -1
# end

# 2. Use a variable to store a number, then write a condition that prints -1 if the number is less than 10, 
# prints 1 if the number is greater than 10, and prints 0 if the number is equal to 10.
# x = 5
# if x < 10
#   p -1
# elsif x > 10
#   p 1
# else
#   p 0
# end

# 3. Use variables to store two numbers, then write a condition that prints 1 if the numbers are both less than 10, and prints 0 otherwise.
# x = 5
# y = 12
# if x < 10 && y < 10
#   p 1
# else
#   p 0
# end

# 4. Use a variable to store a number, then write a condition that prints 1 if the number is over 9000, and prints -1 otherwise.
# x = 500
# if x > 9000
#   p 1
# else 
#   p -1
# end









#//////////Insert a variable into a string using either concatenation or interpolation from memory//////////

# 1. Write a program that uses variables to store a first and last name, 
# then prints the full name in one line using string concatenation (the + operator).
# first_name = "Bob"
# last_name = "Smith"
# puts first_name + " " + last_name
